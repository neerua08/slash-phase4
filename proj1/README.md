# Project 1

- Part1 (easy): for five prior projects, score them according to the [project2 rubic](https://github.com/txt/se23/blob/main/docs/project2.md).
  - Which, in summary, means "does this repo loo **good** (defined before)
  - To make that more precise, score all five repos as per the project2 rubric
    - And note that that we will be using that rubric to score your project2 submissions.
- Part2 (hard): for one prior project, a 2 minute YouTube video (with a 2023 date) showing you can run that system
  - Expectation management:
    - Probably, your first selected project will NOT run in 2023. So you will try this and that and after much cursing, switch to another project.
- Part3 (important): Write 750 words in a mardown file describing what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided and what practices you are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain.
